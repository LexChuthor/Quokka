    The quokka (/ˈkwɒkə/, Setonix brachyurus), the only member of the genus Setonix, is a small macropod about the size
    of a domestic cat.[4] Like other marsupials in the macropod family (such as kangaroos and wallabies), the quokka is herbivorous
    and mainly nocturnal.[5] Quokkas are found on some smaller islands off the coast of Western Australia, particularly Rottnest
    Island, just off Perth, and also Bald Island near Albany, and in isolated scattered populations in forest and coastal
    heath between Perth and Albany. A small colony exists at the eastern limit of their range in a protected area of Two
    Peoples Bay Nature Reserve, where they co-exist with the critically endangered Gilbert's potoroo.[6]
